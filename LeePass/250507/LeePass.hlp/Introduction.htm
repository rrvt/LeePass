<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
KeePass is an open source password vault.  It is composed of two parts: a dynamic link library (dll) that encrypts and
decrypts the data and a user interface.  LeeApp is just a different user interface to the KeePass dll.
</p>
<p>
The app shows one record in the window.  There are two drop down lists on the tool bar that govern which entries viewed 
in the window.  The first drop down list lists the groups one of which is "All Groups".  The second drop down list is the
"Entries" list.  It lists the entries in the group showing in the Group drop down list edit box on the tool bar.  Once a grou is chosen then an entry may be displayed by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking an entry from the toolbar Entries drop down list</li>
<li>
Search for a specific entry with the search command (<img src="Images/Find.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Find">).  
The search may be performed according to several constraints
or attributes specified in the search dialog box.  There may be more than one record that match the seach string.  The
"Search Next" command (<img src="Images/FindNext.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Find Next">) will find the next match.
</li>
<li>
Browse through the entries in the Entries drop down list by using the "<" (e.g. "Previous") and ">" ("Next") toolbard
 commands.  The initial value is the first item on the Entry drop down list.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The operations available are discussed on the 
  <a href="Operations.htm">operations page</a>. </p>
