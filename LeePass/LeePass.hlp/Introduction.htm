<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
KeePass is an open source password vault.  It is composed of two parts: a dynamic link library (dll) that encrypts and decrypts the data and a user interface.  LeeApp is just a different user interface to the KeePass dll.
</p>
<p>
The app shows one record in the window.  The specific record may be chosen in several different ways.  Here are the
the possibilities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick an entry from the toolbar Entries drop down list</li>
<li>
Restrict the number of entries in the toolbar Entries drop down list by selecting a group in the
Group drop down list.
</li>
<li>
Search for a specific entry with the search command.  The search may be performed according to several constraints
or attributes specified in the search dialog box.  There may be more than one record that match the seach string.  The
"Search Next" command will find the next match.
</li>
<li>Browse through the entries in the Entries drop down list by using the "<" and ">" toolbard commands</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The operations available are discussed on the 
  <a href="Operations.htm">operations page</a>. </p>
