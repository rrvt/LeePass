<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
KeePass is an open source password vault.  It is composed of two parts: a dynamic link library (dll) that encrypts and
decrypts the data and a user interface.  LeeApp is just a different user interface to the KeePass dll.
</p>
<p>
The app shows one record in the window.  There are two drop down lists on the tool bar that govern which entries viewed 
in the window.  The first drop down list lists the groups one of which is "All Groups".  The second drop down list is the
"Entries" list.  It lists the entries in the group showing in the Group drop down list edit box on the tool bar.  Once a grou is chosen then an entry may be displayed by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking an entry from the toolbar Entries drop down list</li>
<li>
Search for a specific entry with the search command (<img src="Images/Find.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Find">).  
The search may be performed according to several constraints
or attributes specified in the search dialog box.  There may be more than one record that match the seach string.  The
"Search Next" command (<img src="Images/FindNext.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Find Next">) will find the next match.
</li>
<li>
Browse through the entries in the Entries drop down list by using the "&lt;" (e.g. "Previous") and "&gt;" ("Next") toolbard
 commands.  The initial value is the first item on the Entry drop down list.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When an entry is visible in the app three commands on the menu bar will help view the web site and login.  The 
commands are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start URL -- Send url to the default browser</li>
<li>Copy UserName -- Copies the User Name to the clipboard</li>
<li>Copy Password -- Copies the password to the clipboard for 30 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the app starts it is in Read Only mode.  One can browse or find entries make changes in the entries and when the
app exits nothing will be saved.  To edit an entry or create a new one one must execute the toggle Save/Read Only State
command (<img src="Images/Edit.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Toggle">).  One feature of the Toggle command is that
when the app is in the Save State
a button (<img src="Images/Key.jpg" width="18" height="18" alt="Key">) will appear next to the password. The key button,
when pressed will generate a new password and insert it into the entry's password box.  A new password may be generated 
using the menu command Tools/Generate Password.
</p>

<h3>House Keeping</h3>
<p>
As with all databases there are a slew of housekeeping commands.  One can create a new database, open an existing 
database, login in to the currently selected database, create a new entry, create a new password for an existing entry,
explicitly save an entry, delete an entry, delete a group of entries (i.e. delete a group).
</p>

<p>
The status line on the bottom border of the app shows the current state of the app as best as can be executed.  The path
to the database, the number of groups and entries in the database is displayed in the right half.  The current record 
and Save/Read Only state is shown in the left half.  Copying entities to the clipboard is shown in the left half.
</p>

<h3>LastPass</h3>
<p>
LastPass is a commercial password vault and integrates with Firefox nicely.  This vault is a backup.  Export the entities
from LastPass and import them into LeePass.  One can also export from LeePass and import into LastPass.  The resulting 
entries in LastPass don't appear to be exactly the same as the entries that were exported from LastPass but they are 
similar.  The commands are on the toolbar in a drop down menu captioned LastPass:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Import Lastpass File  -- reads the Comma Separated Value (csv) file</li>
<li>Export a Lastpass File  -- writes a Comma Separated Value (csv) file</li>
<li>Expunge File -- writes random characters over the content of the file, then deletes it</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The operations available are discussed on the 
  <a href="Operations.htm">operations page</a>. </p>
